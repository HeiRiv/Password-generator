## Description
On the second project we develop from scratch a website with our portfolio. A professional portfolio is a compilation of our work samples, our accomplishments and accreditations. It can serve as documentation or proof of our skills and abilities for futures references in a job, this project was really challenging but it was also fun trying the different concepts we have been larning on the bootcamp.

## Achievements
Started with the construction of the website from scratch
Added my personal style and pictures following my design
Added the paragraphs and titles/subtitles for each section
Divided the html file following the correct structure
Orginized the div's, id's and classes on the CSS to give my portfolio a good structure
Setted up the buttons with background images and make them work properly when clicking them
placed my email with a link so when clicking on it you will be redirected to a ''new email'' so you can send me an email.
Made the elements on the main bar interactive so when clicking on them will take you directly to the topic.

## Final Product
